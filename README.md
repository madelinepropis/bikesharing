## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to learn how a bike share business works. Using data from NYC's Citi bikes, I used Tableau to create visualizations to begin creating a business proposal for a bike sharing company in Des Moine, Iowa. This Tableau story is created with investors as the audience in mind.

## Results

### Trips Overview

The Trips Overview section of the Tableau story contains a dashboard with two visualizations. The User Trips by Gender by Weekday plot displays data showing the number of customers and subscribers for each gender for each day of the week. The Trips by Weekday per Hour displays data regarding the time of the day for each day of the week that there are rides.

### Trips by Hour per Gender

The Trips by Hour per Gender plot displays similar data to the previous Trips by Weekday per Hour, but it split by gender. This plot shows that both men and women ride more frequently during rush hour. It also shows that men ride more frequently than women.

### Checkout Times

The Checkout Times part of the story shows two graphs. Both graphs display the length of rides, but one graph is split by gender. For both genders, the majority of rides are around 10 minutes. Rarely any rides last longer than 45 minutes.

### Starting and Ending Locations

The last section of the Tableau story is the Starting and Ending locations. As shown in the graph, it can be determined that the more frequent starting locations are also the more frequent ending locations. There are also no bikes brought outside of the city area. It is also shown that there is a large number of bike stations throughout the city.

## Summary

Overall, it can be determined that men use NYC Citi bikes more frequently than women. Additionally, the most rides occur during on the weekdays during rush hour: Monday-Friday 7AM-10AM and Monday-Friday 4PM-10PM.

To plan for a bike sharing company in Des Moine, Iowa, there should be maintenance during the night, especially avoiding rush hour. Also, there should be a bike station 10 minutes apart or less for each station as most rides are around 10 minutes.

With the given data, there are more visualizations that can be created for future analysis. One additional analysis could be a line graph displaying the number of rides for each birth year (realistically showing age). Also, there can be a graph showing the trip durations for each user type. This can help determine how and what to market. Additionally, this data can help with pricing decisions.
